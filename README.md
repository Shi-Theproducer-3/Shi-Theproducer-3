<h1 class="github-hdr">Hi  ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Shi-Theproducer-3 aka K</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m interested in just about <em>anything</em> under the sun if you can make it <strong>interesting</strong>. I enjoy nature, football(<em>american</em>), basketball, and coding. You know, the usual.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m currently learning the basic, <strong><em>HTML/CSS/JS</em></strong>. Pretty solid grasp on HTML/CSS, java will be fun though. (haha) <em>sigh</em></p>
<p>Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any start up webpage designs. I also use <strong>figma</strong> for designing and making NFTs and stuff, so I'm a creative at heart. <strong>Any</strong> challenges put in front of me I'll try to tackle though.</p>
<p><strong>How to reach me <em>@IHD_NFTs on twitter shi.theproducer on insta</em> or send me an email @ <em>shi.theproducer@gmail.com</em></strong></p>
