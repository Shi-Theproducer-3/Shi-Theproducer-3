<h1>Hi  👋, I’m @Shi-Theproducer-3 aka K</h1>
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything under the sun if you can make it interesting. I enjoy nature, football(american), basketball, and coding. You know, the usual.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic, HTML/CSS/JS. Pretty solid grasp on HTML/CSS, java will be fun though. (haha)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any start up webpage designs. I also use figma for designing and making NFTs and stuff, so I'm a creative at heart. Any challenges put in front of me I'll try to tackle though.
- 📫 How to reach me @IHD_NFTs on twitter shi.theproducer on insta or send me an email @ shi.theproducer@gmail.com
